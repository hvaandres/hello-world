# HELLO - WORLD


My name is Andres Haro, I have 25 years old, and I’m currently attending college to get my bachelors degree in Technology Management with an emphasis in Computer Science. 

To be honest, this is the first time that I'm creating something fun for myself. In other words, I’m putting together all my creativity, ideas, and coding experience to be able to fit in the tech world.

I’m currently working at Instructure as Technical Support Engineer where I’m doing some manual and automated testing. Also, this job gives me the opportunity to start knowing more about programming languages. 

In my previous experience, I worked at a company called Morinda, INC. My position here was Web & Software QA where I implemented different methodologies to apply API and Different types of testing to make sure Morinda’s online store run without issues around the World.

My story is long but, I think I can share a very brief part of what I was doing and what I'm doing now. To give you an idea of what I'm talking about you will need to pay attention to this: 

“ I'm one of the lucky guys around of the world because I was born in the United States, I grew in two different countries and because I grew up in two different cultures at the same time. Moreover, I decided to move back to the United States in 2014 to start working on my dreams, and to start building things with my computer science knowledge, and my creativity. At this current moment, I'm working on building my blog, and vlog to be able to share my experiences as Mexican American Person."


Afterwords, and after work, I’m driving to places far away to take the most impressive pictures and to know all the beautiful places close to us.
